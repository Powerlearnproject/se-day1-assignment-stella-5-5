#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
   The term *software engineering* was first introduced at the **NATO Software Engineering Conference** in 1968. This conference was organized in response to the "software crisis," where software projects were plagued by cost overruns, delays, and failures. The event marked the beginning of structured software development methodologies and emphasized the need for engineering principles in software design.

2. The Development of Structured Programming (1970s)
   During the 1970s, **structured programming** became a major advancement in software development. Introduced by **Edsger Dijkstra**, structured programming emphasized breaking down software into smaller, reusable modules using control structures such as loops and conditionals. This approach improved software readability, maintainability, and reduced errors, laying the foundation for modern programming practices.

3. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s - 1990s)
   Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged as a significant paradigm shift in software development. With languages like **Smalltalk, C++, and later Java**, OOP introduced concepts such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and scalable software systems. OOP revolutionized software engineering by making software more maintainable and adaptable to change.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning-This phase involves gathering requirements, defining project scope, estimating costs, and creating a project roadmap.
2.Requirement analysis-Developers and business analysts work with stakeholders to gather functional and non-functional requirements.
3.design-Architects and designers create system architecture, data models, and user interface designs.
4.implementation-Developers write code based on design specifications using suitable programming languages and frameworks.
5.Testing-The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
6.Testing-The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
7.Maintenance and Support-Developers provide updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next, best for projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., government systems). Agile is iterative, allowing flexibility and continuous feedback, ideal for dynamic projects like mobile app development.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code; implements features and fixes bugs.
QA Engineer – Tests software for bugs and performance issues; ensures quality standards.
Project Manager – Oversees development, manages timelines, budgets, and team coordination.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**IDEs** improve productivity by providing code editing, debugging, and automation tools (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA). **VCS** tracks changes, enables collaboration, and prevents data loss (e.g., Git, GitHub). Both are essential for efficient software development.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly (e.g., testing a login function).  
2. Integration Testing – Verifies interactions between integrated modules to detect communication issues (e.g., API calls between frontend and backend).  
3. System Testing – Evaluates the entire software system for functionality, performance, and security (e.g., testing an e-commerce platform).  
4. Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets business and user requirements before deployment (e.g., user testing before product launch).  

All types enhance software quality, reliability, and performance.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering- is the practice of crafting effective prompts to optimize AI model responses. It is crucial for improving accuracy, relevance, and efficiency when interacting with AI, enabling better automation, content generation, and problem-solving.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."  
Improved Prompt:"Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity, with examples of real-world applications."  

Why It’s More Effective:The improved prompt is specific, clear, and targeted, ensuring a focused and relevant response.
